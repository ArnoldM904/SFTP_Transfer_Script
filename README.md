SFTP_Transfer_Script
====================

REQUIRES WinSCP (Free software - No ads, spam, spyware, bloatware, etc.. Don't worry.)
Link: http://winscp.net/eng/download.php

This is a FTP script I made that was designed to be automated to activate once a day and backup 5 files from a local filesystem to a "Backups" folder in said filesystem and then download the new copies of 5 said files from a SFTP site onto our local filesystem, over-writing the existing copies. Please note for obvious reasons I replaced any private information such as folder names, ftp info, etc.. To use this script you must tailor it to meet the names of files, folders, etc you want to use. Also please note that this script was made with the assumption you have WinSCP installed (It's free if you don't have it.)

Now updated with:
- Uploading
- Time-Stamps
- More documentation
- More love <3
